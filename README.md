# fNIRS Cognitive Load Detection with CNNs

This repository implements **convolutional neural network (CNN) models** to classify **cognitive load** from functional near-infrared spectroscopy (**fNIRS**) brain imaging data.  

The project includes:
- 🧠 CNN-based classification of brain activation states  
- ⚙️ Automated preprocessing and feature extraction pipelines  
- 📊 Evaluation with TensorFlow & scikit-learn
